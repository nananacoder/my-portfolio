  Hello, stranger! **My name is Anki**. 
  After graduating with an engineering degree from college, 
  I embarked on a journey into programming. 
  I love playing games since I was young and always 
  very curious to know how software all worked under the hood. 
  I started to self-learning about web development and launched my career. 
  I chose **backend development** because I am interested in knowing how the product works 
  behind the scenes, in a place where the user sees nothing and does not know how the information is processed, 
  how it is stored, etc.
  
  In 2019, I moved to New Zealand, completed a Master's degree in Computer Science. Since then, 
  I have been working as a backend developer, continuously honing my skills.

  Over the past years as an SWE, I've grown from a novice programmer into a senior developer capable of 
  handling complex challenges independently. This journey has not only shaped my technical abilities 
  but also strengthened my confidence in my role.


  When I'm not coding, I enjoy outdoor activities like running and hiking. 
  I'm also a passionate music lover and language learner. 
  My love for nature and animals drives my enjoyment of traveling with those 
  close to me. Iâ€™m also an avid reader, with a particular interest in novels, self management and psychology.
