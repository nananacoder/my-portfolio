I contributed to the Bluedon firewall system, a large web application where the Python team was responsible for managing the backend business logic related to security and network functionalities. In addition to backend development, I also optimized the database and backend architecture. My contributions include increasing system task dispatching speed by refactoring messaging design patterns with Apache Thrift, improving database access efficiency through database sharding, achieving real-time network traffic behavior and statistical analysis for users, and developing security backend logic, including parallel processing for attack logs, user tactics authentication, and real-time system monitoring.
