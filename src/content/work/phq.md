As a Backend Developer with experience from 2021 to 2024, I primarily contributed to Google Ads Asian advertising and gaming projects. I’ve led and participated in the design and implementation of scalable backend systems, RESTful APIs, and cloud environments. My expertise includes technical leadership, maintaining code quality through thorough reviews and CI/CD pipelines, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams. I’ve also administered cloud infrastructures and provided continuous customer support, all while ensuring that technical solutions align with business and design goals.
