Rare with Google was designed to feed the industry pipeline with historically excluded talent; to give individuals the tools and networks they need to thrive at every stage of their career; and to help allies create a more inclusive working environment for them to do so.

Through a program of bespoke training, research, resources, meet-ups and mentorship, this experimental platform-turned-global movement offers a critical foot-in-the-door to those entering the industry as well as ongoing counsel as they rise into leadership positions of their own.
