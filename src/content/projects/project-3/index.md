A year-long engagement program that kept YouTube Koreaâ€™s core partners engaged and excited about what the platform could do for them.

The 2022 YouTube Delivery Campaign invited partners to register for an exclusive year-long journey with YouTube. When each quarter, a physical delivery arrived, the recipient was encouraged online to discover new content, games, and quizzes. Over the year a public scoreboard tracked the partners with the greatest content engagement.
