A dynamic new website for New Zealandâ€™s most awarded tertiary institution for creative and digital technology.

Choosing a tertiary education institution has always been a big moment, and these days it generally means a lot of time spent online researching different schools. The Media Design School site needed to hold a comprehensive amount of information from all the different courses and disciplines it offers, to details about the physical campus environments.

Balancing a global brand approach, we built the site to create an as-intuitive-as-possible navigation.

It was important also to look carefully at the enrolment process, and we ensured advanced automation improved the experience for both English-first and English-second language speakers.
